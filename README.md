## Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute docs. All documentation is in the docs directory, and the writing style can refer to the existing documentation.

You can debug the docs locally with the following command:
```
npm run start
```

When your pull request is merged, the bot is automatically built and published to the `gh-pages` branch and eventually visible in [koordinator.sh](https://koordinator.sh).
